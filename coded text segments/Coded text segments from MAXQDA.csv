Vulnerability to heat stress and heat exhaustion in extreme heat conditions is more likely when there is a diagnosis of mental illness. As such a lower activation threshold is attributed to people registered to mental health services. Vulnerability may be exacerbated by: 
 Medication prescribed for mental and physical illness,  Other co-morbidities, and 
 Living/environmental conditions. 
The principles outlined support people accessing SA Health Mental Health Services receive a heat vulnerability assessment and information on how to manage in extreme heat. In addition, if a person is assessed as vulnerable, they will receive increased monitoring during an extreme heat event to reduce the risk of harmful effects of extreme heat. Activation of monitoring, for mental health services will begin on day three of a low intensity heatwave, lasting five days or more, and on day one of a severe or extreme heatwave lasting three days or more. 
Each LHN is responsible for ensuring that arrangements to support people accessing mental health services are developed and that they are in alignment with and supportive of this document. 
Mental Health teams within all LHNs have a sound understanding of people experiencing mental health distress and a key part of the initial assessment and ongoing clinical relationship is to ensure that the person and any relevant risk factors are known and understood by the respective clinical teams. 
It is agreed and acknowledged that the following principles accurately reflect the key operational strategies for mental health teams during extreme heat events: 
 Mental Health executive staff in LHNs will receive notification via the Heatwave distribution list (DL) notification process 
 Heatwave Watch and Act Warning - event actions are determined by the LHN extreme heat plan including the determination to stand down an activation, if required. 
 Heatwave Emergency Warning - event actions are determined by the LHN extreme heat plan and State Command will advise when a reduced threat has been issued by SASES. 
 The welfare of people accessing mental health services is of priority and the LHN mental health clinicians / teams will ensure that ongoing, dynamic assessments are undertaken in relation to people and their welfare during extreme heat events. 
To support the above, people registered to mental health services will have a heat vulnerability assessment conducted by Mental Health Services staff using the Heat Vulnerability Assessment Tool (HVAT) on CBIS/CCCME. If assessed as vulnerable, then a heat vulnerability alert must be registered on CBIS/CCCME. All people registered to mental health services will also be provided with a written information package on managing health during extreme heat events. 
It is the mental health services responsibility to ensure identified vulnerable people are contacted during an extreme heat activation. If a person accessing mental health services is assessed as vulnerable and requires contact, mental health staff will register the person within local structures to ensure that they are contacted.

Table 1: Principles of integrated planning11 
Principle This means council will: 
Identify areas for action using the four environments for health 
Take into consideration the built, social, economic and natural environments in identifying issues and determining appropriate strategies. 
Ask questions using the best available information to understand the issues 
Research available data and seek the advice of experts on local health outcomes, patterns of behaviour, service needs and opportunities. This is compared with relevant regional, state and national trends. 
Listen to the community 
Encourage people to have a say and be heard: both their concerns and their solutions. Actions are meaningful to the local community, attract local participation and are locally driven. 
Reduce the risks of health and wellbeing inequality 
Ensure that vulnerable population groups in the community are specifically supported to avoid the risks and minimise harm. 
Choose action based on what is most likely to work 
Evaluate what has been tried in the past and research what others have done so that action is based on evidence and more likely to provide achievable and measurable outcomes. 
Work in partnership with communities, the private sector, the community sector and other tiers of government 
Actively engage partners across a broad range of sectors — remembering that using the four environments means many might not be traditional health partners. Partnership reduces duplication and maximises effort. 
Build capacity across the community Use information, skill development, support and advocacy to increase the capacity of individuals and community partners to contribute to solutions. 
Other trends in planning in local government 
Planning in local government has seen a number of trends recently that have influenced best practice, including community strengthening and engagement. 
People being connected to others in neighbourhoods, communities and society (referred to as ‘social capital’) has focused attention on the capacity of community members and local networks. 
Communities high in social capital are high in resilience and self-reliance and more active in dealing with local needs and issues. This has led to an investment in community strengthening or community capacity building. Community strengthening involves the active creation of sustainable networks and partnerships of local stakeholders and community members to achieve agreed outcomes through mechanisms such as integrated planning, collaboration and skill development.

The Chief Health Officer is accountable for issuing Heat Health Alerts. 
The DHHS monitors the daily weather forecasts and calculates the daily average temperature for each weather forecast district, to determine whether a heat health alert should be issued. 
The DHHS has identified heat health temperature thresholds for each weather forecast district above which heat related illness and mortality will increase substantially.

Turn-Down-the-Heat-Strategy-and-Action-Plan-2018-1,Mental Health Interventions or Plans,"Reducing the risks and impacts of urban heat as Western Sydney grows presents a tremendous opportunity to build upon existing momentum and collaborate as a region to realise diverse benefits from adaptation efforts. For example, adaptation efforts that create a greener Western Sydney will help to cool our urban areas, but trees also have myriad other benefits including improved physical and mental health of residents, increased property values, and improved air and water quality. A detailed action plan outlining specific actions and specific benefits realised by those actions in reducing urban heat and creating a more livable Western Sydney can be found in the following section. 
We need to work together to manage heat impacts. 
Listed below are key actions to address the issue of extreme heat. Not one of these interventions alone can solve the issue of heat, all are critical and interlinked. The effectiveness of any strategy will vary according to the location, urban context, geography and climatic zone. 
Emergency and health response 
While mitigation is crucial, we must also prepare for extreme heat events and heatwaves by ensuring we have appropriate emergency and health responses in place. 
Education 
It is critical that communities understand the health risks of extreme heat and can take action accordingly. Ensuring that people stay healthy and look out for others, but also equipping communities with the knowledge and resources to minimise their contribution to the problem. 
Cool materials 
Building materials are major contributors to the urban heat island effect. They store heat and by doing so reduce indoor and outdoor thermal comfort. Choosing materials that prevent solar radiation (heat) from being absorbed can make a significant difference. Examples include light coloured roofs or pavers. 
Infrastructure adaptation 
Preparing our city’s infrastructure to cope with extreme temperatures is critical for our economy and to ensure the community has access to cooling, water and transport when they need it most. 
Research 
We must continue to build our understanding of impactful interventions and ensure information is accessible to key decision makers. 
Designing with water 
Water is one of the most effective ways to cool an urban environment. Designing with water can consist of a mix of natural water bodies, fountains, ponds, and technologies to integrate urban evaporative cooling systems. 
Greening urban areas 
Urban canopy cover and green spaces contribute to shade and evapotranspiration. Species selection, planting location and maintenance are critical to ensure optimum cooling benefits.", ,,"Search term > mental health  (Weight: 0)

The NSW Government has made a landmark $230 million funding commitment to plant five million trees across Sydney.29 However, planting the right trees in the right place with the right maintenance plan is essential to maximising the benefits of this significant investment. Management of Western Sydney's urban forest requires a clear strategy for keeping trees healthy in stress (drought) conditions and for identifying and supplementing areas that lack adequate tree canopy. 
Western Sydney’s urban forest management could be supported by a detailed tree inventory. Research funding could be leveraged to undertake the significant investment of a comprehensive tree inventory for urban areas in Western Sydney. An urban forest strategy will bring city-wide benefits that cannot be achieved by individual councils, suburbs, infrastructure operators, or neighbourhoods in isolation. 
Benefits 
A greener Western Sydney means shadier, cooler public areas, lower flood risk, and less runoff entering waterways. Trees have been shown to increase property values in neighbourhoods and to increase energy efficiency of homes.30 Greener cities also have lower levels of obesity, higher levels of physical activity, and improved mental health. As well as broader societal benefits, trees and green infrastructure have very important direct transport benefits in terms of soil erosion, weed control, graffiti deterrence, wayfinding, visual cues and headlight glare avoidance.", ,,"Search term > mental health  (Weight: 0)

The Melbourne Urban Forest Strategy serves as a useful example for process and delivery of an urban forest strategy in Western Sydney. Melbourne’s strategy seeks to manage significant challenges of climate change, population growth and urban heating and protect against future vulnerability by providing a robust strategic framework for the evolution and longevity of Melbourne’s urban forest. The strategy aims to adapt Melbourne city to climate change, mitigate the urban heat island effect by bringing inner-city temperatures down, create healthier ecosystems, become a water-sensitive city, and engage and involve the community. 
The strategy sets clear targets for an increase in canopy cover from 22% to 40% by 2040, increasing forest diversity with no more than 5% of one tree species, no more than 10% of one genus and no more than 20% of any one family, improving vegetation health, improving soil moisture, improving biodiversity, informing and consulting with the community.", ,,

The Guidelines recognise the need for urban environments to withstand projected increase in extreme heatwaves, intense storms and localised flooding. OEH includes a range of urban green cover strategies such as vegetated and reflective roofs, green walls, street plantings, permeable and reflective road surfaces, and open spaces and parks. These combined approaches to cool urban environments will also provide ecosystem services such as stormwater management, clean air, and habitats in addition to reduced energy costs for cooling.

The NSW Health Beat The Heat program and Cool Parramatta engagement strategy can be used as models for the strategy. Current heatwaves will be used as opportunities to call attention to heatwaves as a risk and to educate and change public attitudes. Local community groups and council planners should team with educational outlets (schools) and the media to disseminate information across a wide variety of outlets. 
An engagement strategy informed by local community leaders who know their citizens best will be most effective in sharing information, informing decision making, and helping create better prepared communities. This strategy delivered at a regional level will generate efficiencies over each individual council creating its own outreach program.

In 2016, WSU’s Institute for Culture and Society produced a Pilot Research Report titled ‘Cooling the Commons’, the study sought to explore insights into how residents living in Western Sydney keep cool during the hottest parts of the year and how they would like to see their communities improved to address wellbeing in the face of increasing extreme heat events. The study presented a range of innovative and practical methods that people in Western Sydney are already employing to help beat the heat. Examples ranged from spending more time in shopping malls, cafes and air-conditioned spaces (for example the play areas within McDonalds) to enjoying green spaces. One of the three groups interviewed as part of the research comprised a selection of senior citizens from Penrith. This group provided some interesting insights on the variety of cooling strategies they adopted around the home and for conserving their energy use during the hot weather. 
“Participants discussed wetting and hanging, or draping material, or freezing water in cake tins and blowing cold air over them as cooling strategies.” Those with air-conditioning also discussed the selfimposed rules they had introduced around when it could be used, “I have rules…it has to be at least 30°C – usually my body can tell me. The other day it was 34°C before I turned it on…as soon as it starts to cool down, we turn it off” (WSU, 2016, p. 15 – 16).", ,,Search term > wellbeing (Weight: 0)

8.1 Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) Framework for Heat Stress - ‘B.E.A.T. the Heat’ Framework 
There has been a rising trend in Bangladesh in the occurrence of heatwaves in recent years, significantly affecting various aspects of life, including the impacts on health for at-risk population, notably but not limited to pregnant and lactating women (PLW), children, the elderly, and other vulnerable population such as slum residents, individuals residing in tin sheds or temporary roadside structures without a proper ceiling, rickshaw pullers, street vendors, day labourers, frontline workers, co-morbid patients, and people with disabilities. 
Therefore, robust risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) interventions are essential to beat the heat. The heat stress-related RCCE interventions can follow the B.E.A.T. the heat framework to make the at-risk population aware of the impact of heat and preventive measures, enable communities at large to identify the heat stress-related symptoms, promote actions to act immediately, and take the individual to the health facility or a doctor while showing serious symptoms such as heatstroke. Thus, the B.E.A.T. the heat framework for RCCE interventions stands for: 
 BE AWARE of heat stress and protect yourself: Recognize heat stress and know what actions to take 
 EASILY IDENTIFY the symptoms: Recognize the symptoms of various heat-related illnesses that caregivers, communities and frontline workers need to know 
 ACT IMMEDIATELY to protect: Learn the first-aid actions that caregivers and frontline workers need to take to rebalance body heat in short term; and 
 TAKE to a health facility: If an individual is showing serious symptoms, especially signs of heatstroke, frontline workers, community stakeholders and caregivers should recognize the symptoms immediately and help take the individual to a health facility", ,,
SEARO,Bangladesh. National Guideline on Heat-Related Illness_2024,General Interventions ,"8.5 Community Action to Reduce the Risk of Heat-Related Illness (HRI) 
Community actions are crucial in reducing the impact of heatwaves on human health. Informed and awared individuals within the community can play a significant role by encouraging everyone to stay hydrated and providing clean drinking water to those in need. Additionally, they can advise people to take regular breaks from work during peak heat hours and establish community cooling centers in neighborhoods to provide temporary shelter for those seeking a break from the heat. 
Furthermore, community members, especially youth groups, can organize themselves to regularly check on vulnerable groups such as the elderly, individuals with special needs, those with co-morbidities, children, pregnant mothers, etc. Their efforts can include raising awareness among the vulnerable population in the community about the impact of heat, ensuring access to life-saving supplies, and being aware of community support available, if assistance is needed to transfer individuals to the hospital. These proactive community actions can significantly mitigate the adverse effects of heatwaves on human health and well-being. 
In the long term, community actions must consider following actions but not limited to increasing green spaces, planting trees, and buildings community spaces with natural cooling features, to help mitigate the heat island effect. In addition, the community can also be involved in developing and implementing heat action plans and ensuring healthcare facilities are prepared for managing increased cases of heat-related illnesses. Continuously educating the different groups of the community on coping mechanisms for heatwaves, engaging in community resilience efforts for heat, and advocating for supporting local initiatives to address heatwaves are also essential for the community to consider as a long-term intervention for 
heatwaves in Bangladesh.", ,,"Search term > wellbeing (Weight: 0)

SEARO,India. Gujarat State Action Plan- Prevention and Mitigation of Impacts of Heat Wave 2020,General Interventions ,"Cool Roofing Material 
The choice of an appropriate cool roof material in a particular context depends on a range of 
factors, from existing roof material, life and maintenance, availability, cost, time needed for 
installation and availability of skilled labor. To help cater to a range of contexts, cool roofs 
techniques can be broadly divided into four categories and building owners can choose from 
these techniques as appropriate for implementing cool roofs. 
I. Coated cool roofs: these roofs involve the coating of a material or paint with high 
reflectivity on top of a conventional roof material to increase the roof surface’s solar 
reflectance index. These are liquid applied coatings made of simple materials such as 
lime wash or an acrylic polymer or plastic technology and are usually white in color. 
II. Membrane cool roofs: these roofs involve using pre-fabricated materials such as 
membranes or sheeting to cover an existing roof in order to increase the roof surface’s 
SRI. These types of roofs can be polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or bitumen-based. 
III. Tiled cool roofs: these roofs involve the application of high albedo, china mosaic 
tiles or shingles on top of an existing roof or to a new roof. 
IV. Special cool roof materials such as Mod Roof: these roofs, made of coconut husk 
and paper waste, have been installed in households 
around Gujarat and Delhi and can serve as an 
alternative to reinforced cement concrete roofs. 
V. Green roofs: green roofs make use of vegetation to 
help the roof absorb less solar energy by providing a 
thermal mass layer to reduce flow of heat into a 
building. Vegetation is especially useful in reflecting infrared radiation. Green roofs 
are also considered cool roofs, but due to higher costs and need for water, they are 
likely not a cost-effective solution for heat reduction in low-income communities in 
India. 
The cost implications vary by the type of material used for cool roofing. However, most of 
these materials have been applied locally in India and are available through local vendors. Gujarat State Action Plan: Prevention And Mitigation 
of Impacts of Heat Wave 2020

5.5 Plant trees or erect shade structures in strategic locations. 
Trees and vegetation that directly shade your home can lower surrounding temperatures; this 
can decrease the need for air conditioning, make your home more comfortable, and reduce 
your energy bill. Trees also protect your family’s health by improving air quality, providing 
cooling shade for outdoor activities, and reducing your exposure to the sun. 
5.6 Use cool paving materials in your driveway. 
If you’ve ever walked barefoot on hot pavement, you know it can heat up quickly in the sun. 
Hot pavement also transfers heat to the surrounding air, adding to the urban heat island 
effect. Cool pavement stays cooler in the sun than traditional pavement by reflecting more 
solar energy or enhancing water evaporation. Cool pavement can be created from asphalt and 
concrete, as well as through the use of coatings or grass paving. 
5.7 Replace your old cooling devices. 
Replace the old or damaged cooling units which are inefficient and more energy 
consumption devices, meaning you’re paying more money for less actual cooling ability. We 
should purchase energy efficient devices before we need it. 
5.8 Contribute to a community-wide heat response plan. 
Many state and local governments have already developed plans that identify locations, infrastructure, and people that are vulnerable to climate change and extreme heat. These 
plans also describe actions a community can take to improve resilience. Check online or call 
your local representatives to see if your community has a plan. If you are interested in heat 
response planning efforts in your community, your town or city hall is a great place to start. 
Ask how you can get involved! 
5.9 Find out about local heat alert systems and subscribe to them. 
Local governments, weather stations, medical providers, or others may have systems for 
issuing heat alerts through the television, radio, newspapers, phone calls, social media, texts, emails, or the internet. Find out what systems are in place for your community, and sign up to 
receive alerts. Gujarat State Action Plan: Prevention And Mitigation 
of Impacts of Heat Wave 2020

5.10 Determine whether there are resources for support in your community. 
Community based organizations should come forward to beat the heat wave through supply 
of drinking water and other community wellbeing activities like putting of shade at 
prominent places etc. 
5.11 Recurring / regular activities 
x Putting up display boards for colour coded heat alerts and Do’s and Don’ts in public 
places such as parks, hospitals, etc. 
x Multiple medium of communication (preferably in Gujarati laguage) like TV, Radio and 
newspaper for awareness. 
x Identify and reduce awareness gaps through disseminating of information using 
pamphlets, hoardings, LED display on advertisement boards. 
x Change in timings of schools, colleges, offices, markets etc. 
Suggested short-term and long-term measures to reduce Heat Wave impacts 
5.12 Short-term activities 
x Installing temporary kiosks for shelter and distribution of water, medicines, etc. 
x Developing mobile applications for spreading awareness on heat-related issues and 
locating shelters, drinking water kiosks, etc. 
x Issuing advisories for tourists. 
x Setting up special cool shelters for “Wage Employment Programmes” such as Mahatma 
Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGA). 
x Providing shade and drinking water for on duty traffic personnel. 
5.13 Medium – Term activities 
x LED display boards installed at District Headquarters displaying the real time weather 
data pertaining to rainfall, Temperature, Humidity and Wind Speed should be 
incorporated into precautionary measures for Disaster Management. Gujarat State Action Plan: Prevention And Mitigation 
of Impacts of Heat Wave 2020 
47 | Page 
x Involving Forest department for collecting local coping and adaptation strategies, indigenous technologies such as vernacular building materials, construction of green 
building, energy conservation building codes (ECBC) etc. related to heat wave risk 
mitigation. 
x New heat wave criteria must be evolved based on gridded data with maximum and 
minimum temperature, to develop a scientific model to determine all-cause mortality. 
x Zonal/regional Heat Action Plan for all municipal corporation viz. Ahmadabad, Bhavnagar, Gandhinagar, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Surat and Vadodara. 
x Identify “Heat Hot Spots” in Gujarat through appropriate tracking and modelling of 
meteorological data and promote the timely development and implementation of local 
Heat Action Plans with strategic inter-agency coordination, and a response which targets 
the most venerable groups. 
5.14 Long Term activities 
x Installation of Green Roof Tops to minimizes the in house temperature. x Use of white paint (Chinii Mitti)/ white glazed tiles on rooftops for refrection of Sun rays and avoiding heat wave. x Focused capacity building Heat wave mitigation management should be added in school curriculum to sanitize school children and local people. Training programmes in local level/community level for awareness among people. x Integrate climate variability of heat wave plan through response and feedback data collection. x Operational forecast of maximum temperature over India in short, medium and extended range timescale is very useful in giving Heat Wave Outlook. x Upgradation of forecast system & associated equipments to provide heat wave alerts minimum of 2 to 3 weeks prior to the event. x Health harming air pollution apportionment studies, emission inventories and health 
impact assessments of ambient and household air pollution through State wise Clean Air Action Plans, and use these findings to inform policies targeted at reducing the main sources of pollution via an inter- ministerial approach. x Evaluation of cascading effects of heat waves over flood, drought and hydrological models. x Involvement of academia along with collaboration and more participation from higher educational institutes may be developed. The centres for excellence and dedicated research centres may have pivotal role to play. Gujarat State Ac", ,,Search term > wellbeing (Weight: 0)

The developing bodies of children are sensitive to environmental hazards such as heat waves and the spread of infectious disease and damage experienced during these initial years can have lifelong impacts. In 2007, it is found that more than 200 million children under five years of age in developing countries do not reach their development potential due to poverty, malnutrition and poor health which disrupts their cognitive, physical and socio-emotional development after exposing to hazardous pathogenic agents. Apart from that, lower resistance and poor access to preventive interventions contributes to major part of these causes. Older persons are at risk because of higher rates of medications use, immobility and volume depletion. Older people may have diminished cardiovascular compensation and age-related loss of heat shock proteins that aggravate further intolerance to extreme conditions", ,,"Search term > social (Weight: 0)

SEARO,India. Rajkot-Heat-Action-Plan. 2020,Vulnerable communities,"Gender-sensitive impact of heat stress 
Women and men experience thermal stress differently and gender inequalities affect women's ability to adapt. Studies on gender inequality indicate that women are more likely to suffer the various effects of climate change. Their lack of awareness of adaptation and mitigation measures and exclusion in adaptation decision-making behaviour are mutually reinforcing that increases their exposure and vulnerability. 
Given lower thresholds of physical endurance and generally poor nutritional status apart from the biological factors, it is critical to know the health effects of heat stress or thermal stress among women, especially socially and economically marginalised, to draw any adaptive intervention or policy formulation to ensure their well-being and economic productivity 
The study showed broad-based heat distress among the poor working women at a subsistence level of employment. Most of them reported suffering from heat exhaustion, heat rash, dehydration, fatigue and not being able to seek medical advice to avoid spending on medical consultation and medicines. Dehydration was reported by women with poor access to drinking water at the workplace. 
The study done by IRADe suggests a higher vulnerability to heat stress for poor working women with inadequate access to resources and information and control over the available resources. Heat stress vulnerability of pregnant women can even be higher.", ,,Search term > wellbeing (Weight: 0)

Extreme heat is dangerous for everyone, but the elderly (over 65) and chronically ill people are particularly vulnerable groups. 
The heat itself causes the superficial blood vessels to 
dilate and the sweating increases. If you do not have time to take in enough fluid to compensate for the 
increased evaporation, the blood becomes more concentrated and the risk of blood clots in the heart and brain increases. If the heart cannot cope with the increased demands on pumping capacity, it can result in severe heart failure. 
With a changing climate, we can count on both a rising average temperature and extreme weather conditions such as heat waves and high temperatures becoming more common. As we in Sweden are not so used to high temperatures, negative health effects are already seen at lower temperature levels than, for example, in tropical countries. 
It is well known that heat waves and high temperatures can lead to health problems and an increased number of deaths, especially in the elderly population. The daily mortality rate increases by approximately ten percent if the temperature reaches 26 degrees or more for three days in a row, and it increases by another ten percent if the temperature reaches 30 degrees or more for three days in a row.

Health effects of heat wave and high temperatures 
Machine Translated by GoogleReactions and symptoms to heat 
• Cramps due to dehydration (dehydration) and disturbance in salt 
balance (electrolyte loss). Mainly seen during intense sports in the heat. 
• Rash, small itchy red bumps. This is harmless and will pass 
• Swelling (edema) – usually manifests as swollen ankles. 
• Exhaustion: nausea, vomiting and circulatory collapse. The majority of increased morbidity/mortality during heatwave/high temperatures is 
due to cardiovascular disease and lung disease, as well as medication effects. However, you should be aware that there are a number

Januskovecz: We are especially concerned about persons with few social contacts, whose isolation may be intensified by heatwaves, causing enormous mental stress. How can we best reach out to these individuals? 
Hutter: I have been studying this issue since the historic heatwave of 2003. In addition to strain on the psyche, an important factor is physical stress, which sometimes is recognised too late – for example, because relatives and physicians are on holiday. Reaching out to people who are difficult to reach is key to saving lives. But this is very hard to do even today, in our modern society. Several possible solutions do exist – for example, French cities draw on registers of residents to reach single individuals aged over 65 years, which makes it possible to ensure assistance by social workers during hot spells. However, the implementation of such models is very time-consuming and resource-intensive. It would be easiest if other people living in the same building took care of these individuals. However, close neighbourly relations that entail mutual assistance have become a rarity in modern residential buildings. Often, we only realise that a neighbour might have needed our help when that person has passed away without anybody noticing.

EURO,Austria. Vienna Heat Action Plan. 2022,Mental Health Outcomes ,"People suffering from mental diseases 
The most widespread mental illnesses are anxiety disorders, followed by alcoholrelated disorders and depression. Patients are frequently affected by several mental diseases that may reinforce each other. For example, depression is frequently found in conjunction with anxiety disorders. In case of conditions such as depression, selfcare is reduced. People suffering from them are slower to take action to improve their own situation. Schizophrenia patients experience diminished physical sensations so that they may not notice that they are sweating. Others cannot bear the heat at all and increasingly isolate themselves when temperatures are high. Moreover, only a small percentage of people affected by mental diseases have contacts with the medical system. This lack of contact makes it more difficult to reach out to them and support them. 
During hot periods, anxiety and depression increase markedly among the elderly or predisposed people. They cannot escape the heat and are afraid of the next heatwave. People having mental problems feel additional stress when it is hot. Patients suffering from anxiety or panic disorders seldom attribute symptoms such as shortness of breath or mild circulatory problems to the heat. Instead, panic attacks become more frequent. 
Psychiatric drugs, such as tranquillisers, neuroleptics, serotonin agonists and antidepressants, strain the cardiovascular system and increase the heat vulnerability of mentally ill people. People suffering from dementia are only able to a limited extent to respond adequately to extreme situations.

Heat harbours massive hazards for the homeless. They are exposed to it without any protection and can only seldom retreat to cool places. Dehydration and circulatory failure may ensue. Clothing soaked with sweat impairs the healing of open wounds. The homeless also face the risk of foodborne infections as they cannot refrigerate food adequately when temperatures are rising.

Green infrastructure (GI) plays an important connectivity role across cities, towns, coastal and rural areas, forming an integral component of ecological networks and building more resilient landscapes. Multi-functional GI innovations offer a way to combat resilience challenges and address stresses of urban living to improve health and wellbeing (26). Examples include: 
• living in closer proximity to green spaces which is associated with improved wellbeing, reduced mental ill-health and reduced health inequalities – children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in contact with naturalenvironments and green spaces have reported significant improvements in symptoms when in 
• green spaces 
• exposure to natural environments or scenes of nature have shown changes in 
physiological stress indicators such as blood pressure, muscle tension and EEG alpha-wave activity 
• access to green spaces and natural environments can increase the likelihoodof physical activity and active travel in adults and children 
Urban green space is a component of green infrastructure. It is an important part of public open spaces and common services provided by a city and can serve as a health-promoting setting for all members of the urban community. It is therefore necessary to ensure that public green spaces are easily accessible for all population groups and distributed equitably within the city", ,,"Search term > wellbeing (Weight: 0)

EURO,UK AWHP_Evidence,Risk factors,"4.4.3. Risk perception of hot weather 
In 2022, UKHSA commissioned a qualitative study with older adults to gain insights on their experiences of the record-breaking high temperatures of that summer. This comprised of focus groups with 14 older adults aged 65 years and over, to understand both their perceptions of the summer 2022 heatwave and its impact on their physical and mental wellbeing. 
In 2019, UKHSA commissioned a survey focused on health risk perception of hot weather following a period of very hot weather in the UK and Europe. A representative sample of the English population aged 65 years of age and over was used for this survey. Quotas were set for age by gender, region, working status and tenure. A binomial logistic regression model was used to assess associations between participants’ risk perception and demographic characteristics (Model 1) and whether they reported having taken action (Model 2). 
In the 2022 study, most focus group participants perceived themselves to be moderately at risk or not at risk at all due to the heat; including those individuals with objectively higher risk due to health comorbidities linked to a higher heat strain. This level of risk perception was rationalised by participants by comparing themselves to other vulnerable groups who participants perceived to be at a higher than themselves (for example babies, individuals aged 85 years and over), and believing that risks were mitigated by performing well-established and effective coping strategies. 
Some participants who were more vulnerable (that is individuals with single or multiple comorbidities) perceived themselves to be at risk; however, they primarily acknowledged the potential for acute illness and did not recognise the potential of increased mortality risk. Other factors associated with risk perception identified by participants included:Adverse Weather and Health Plan: Supporting evidence 
55 
• location (that is, urban areas and the south of England were thought to be more exposed to heat) 
• people living alone were thought to be more vulnerable due to lack of access to support from other household members 
• participants who felt worried about the increasing trend of heatwaves in the future perceived a higher sense of risk 
In the 2019 survey, a higher percentage of older adults who perceived their own health as at risk also perceived other vulnerable groups to be at risk. Interestingly, over a quarter of older adults who did not perceive their own health as at risk reported perceiving other older adults’ health as being at risk during hot weather. However, when older adults were asked about the risk to health of people of the same age as themselves, the perception of risk decreased considerably, suggesting a lower risk perception for themselves and their current age group. 
The findings from this analysis showed there was no clear demographic determinant (such as age or income) that predicted older adults perceiving themselves to be at risk in hot weather. Additionally, perceiving other older people aged 65 years and over was associated with an increased likelihood of older adults’ personal risk perception. 
4.4.3.1. Hot weather-related symptoms 
In the 2022 focus groups, some participants indicated that they relished the hot weather in summer 2022; others did not enjoy the extreme heat episodes but did not find the weather physically uncomfortable and felt they could manage it easily. 
According to the experiences and impact described by older adults included in the study, those living with respiratory conditions, heart conditions, diabetes, and those on certain types of medication, tended to suffer the most, as well as those with mobility issues and those who felt isolated. 
Nearly everyone described some impact of the hot weather on their mental health at some stage during the heat episodes that summer. This ranged from simply being over tired and anxious because of lack of sleep due to the heat, to more extreme sensations of feeling trapped and isolated due to not being able to go outside. 
In the 2019 survey, approximately 20% of older adults included in the hot weather survey reported having no associated symptoms. The most reported heat-related symptoms were: 
• difficulty keeping cool and feeling too hot (40%) 
• difficulty sleeping (52%) 
• physical symptoms such as a headache, dehydration, or sunburn (11%)","allisonstewart, 10/1/24 4:58 PM

medicines for psychiatric disorders; • greater risk of allergies, cancer and hormone disruption due to higher concentrations of pollutants 
Health Effects: 
• greater risk of (deterioration of) kidney disease, respiratory disease, and cardiovascular disease such as strokes and drops in blood pressure; Since 2005, Belgium has had a national ozone and heat plan. This plan describes how the Belgian population will be warned when public health problems are expected due to periods of very hot weather (e.g. heat wave). This plan also takes ozone concentrations into account because they have an additional negative effect on public health during these warm periods. The combination of both temperature and ozone criteria makes the Belgian plan unique. This plan is followed up within the National Environmental Health Action Plan (NEHAP). Representatives of all services involved 
in Belgium (Federal, Region and Community) monitor the implementation and evaluation of the national plan. Until 2014, the Federal government was responsible for the implementation of this plan. More specifically, they were responsible for sending 
out warnings and raising awareness among the population and the actors involved. The regional authorities provided communication 
support. 
• less sleep and therefore more fatigue, less alertness and more severe psychological distress issues; The 6th state reform regionalized the powers for the implementation of the National Ozone and Heat Plan (figure 1). From now on, for Flanders, it is the Department of Care that is responsible for sending out heat warnings and raising awareness of both the general population and organizations and professionals that work with vulnerable groups. The implementation of this is described in the Flemish Heat Action Plan. 
• more premature deaths, for example due to the combination of heat and heart disease; • 
more cases of overheating, dehydration and a lack of salt in the blood; • increased risk 
of premature birth and increased blood pressure in pregnant women; • enhanced effects 
of heat with, for example, diuretic medications and some 
However, the alarm phase, which is regarded as a crisis phase, remains a Federal competence. The regional authorities do support communication during this phase. 
Since 2015, the national ozone and heat plan has bundled all regional and federal initiatives on ozone and heat. Coordination between all authorities continues to take place within the NEHAP.

Impact on mortality 
12 
The main risk factors associated with exposure to high temperatures are: 
Personal factors 
• People over 65 years of age. 
• People with cardiovascular, respiratory and mental diseases (dementia, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,...). 
[10], the risk of mortality attributable to high temperatures increases, with a probability of 
95%, between 9.1% and 10.7% for each degree that the ambient temperature rises above 
the impact threshold on the health due to excessive temperatures in the provinces of Spain. 
The mortality associated with high temperatures in the referenced study was 13,119 deaths 
attributable to high temperatures, that is, about 1,300 deaths/year. In the period studied 
throughout Spain, 4,373 days of extreme heat were recorded (taking into account that 
extreme heat can occur on the same day in several provinces simultaneously and are 
computed differently); That is, every day that there is an episode of extreme heat, mortality 
increases, on average, by 3 deaths/day. 
Excess mortality has been associated with periods of 3 or more consecutive days of 
unusual high temperatures, and its effects can be observed during such periods or with a 
delay of up to three days. 
As calculated for the 2000-2009 time series by the Carlos III Health Institute 
Children who have chronic health problems or those who take certain medications may be, like adults, more susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Furthermore, specific physiological 
characteristics occur in childhood, mostly related to body water composition, sweat pattern 
and metabolic heat production, which put children at a thermoregulatory disadvantage 
compared to adults, especially when They exercise or are very physically active in hot or 
humid environments. On the other hand, minors - and even up to adolescence - cannot or 
do not take the necessary measures to prevent or replace fluid loss, and are exposed to 
direct sunlight to the point of exhaustion if they are not supervised by an adult. Children 
who are overweight or who wear too many clothes, especially if they do not sweat, are also 
more susceptible. 
• Infants and children under 4 years of age. 
• Pregnant women.

Impact on mortality 
12 
The main risk factors associated with exposure to high temperatures are: 
Personal factors 
• People over 65 years of age. 
• People with cardiovascular, respiratory and mental diseases (dementia, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,...). 
[10], the risk of mortality attributable to high temperatures increases, with a probability of 
95%, between 9.1% and 10.7% for each degree that the ambient temperature rises above 
the impact threshold on the health due to excessive temperatures in the provinces of Spain. 
The mortality associated with high temperatures in the referenced study was 13,119 deaths 
attributable to high temperatures, that is, about 1,300 deaths/year. In the period studied 
throughout Spain, 4,373 days of extreme heat were recorded (taking into account that 
extreme heat can occur on the same day in several provinces simultaneously and are 
computed differently); That is, every day that there is an episode of extreme heat, mortality 
increases, on average, by 3 deaths/day. 
Excess mortality has been associated with periods of 3 or more consecutive days of 
unusual high temperatures, and its effects can be observed during such periods or with a 
delay of up to three days. 
As calculated for the 2000-2009 time series by the Carlos III Health Institute 
Children who have chronic health problems or those who take certain medications may be, like adults, more susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Furthermore, specific physiological 
characteristics occur in childhood, mostly related to body water composition, sweat pattern 
and metabolic heat production, which put children at a thermoregulatory disadvantage 
compared to adults, especially when They exercise or are very physically active in hot or 
humid environments. On the other hand, minors - and even up to adolescence - cannot or 
do not take the necessary measures to prevent or replace fluid loss, and are exposed to 
direct sunlight to the point of exhaustion if they are not supervised by an adult. Children 
who are overweight or who wear too many clothes, especially if they do not sweat, are also 
more susceptible. 
• Infants and children under 4 years of age. 
• Pregnant women.

• People who live alone, on the street and/or in social and economic conditions 
• People with difficulties adapting to heat. 
• Environmental pollution. 
Although the previous mechanisms act in a general way, local factors play a decisive role, since they 
determine the comfort temperature, the threshold temperatures to be considered and the temperaturemortality association, that is, the magnitude of the impact. 
• Excessive exposure to heat for work reasons (manual work outdoors or that require high contact with 
hot environments), sports (sports of great physical intensity) or leisure.

There were 22 days of air quality advisories in the Lower Mainland in 2018, the most on record. Research by the BC Centre for Disease Control found that visits to the doctor with asthma or respiratory complaints spiked during the poor air quality days in the Lower Mainland.

increased risk of death resulting from exposure to excess heat.13 EHEs are associated with increases in 
mortality, among older adults, those with chronic illnesses, those with mental illness, and materially and 
socially disadvantaged people.14 Risks of adverse effects are also higher for people who use substances, have poor quality housing, or who work outdoors.15 Chronic conditions that put people at higher risk 
include mental illnesses, substance use disorders, heart disease, diabetes, and respiratory disease. 
People taking certain medications such as antipsychotics, antidepressants, or diuretics are also at higher 
risk.

The cohorts of the population most impacted by the June 2021 heat dome in B.C. were largely adults 
aged 50 years and older. These individuals often shared commonalities such as social isolation17 or

Austin’s first Heat Resilience Playbook identifies 
neighborhood-based and citywide projects, programs, and policies that can be leveraged to combat extreme heat. This Playbook seeks to uplift existing City-led heat resilience efforts and outline 
a series of high-impact actions that the City of Austin can take to build heat resilience. 
The actions outlined in this Playbook are structured through a three-pillar approach that focuses on individuals, neighborhoods, and our built and living environment. Strategies and actions identified are informed by Austin’s most recent localized extreme heat data and the latest international best practices. The strategies and actions are also a result of workshops, departmental meetings, office hours, and individual review efforts in collaboration with and consultation from City departments and Austin community members. Each action has an associated City department champion assigned based on interest, capacity, and alignment with existing City department jurisdiction and responsibilities.", ,,

Pilot cool corridors by designing and deploying cooling strategies such as trees and built shade on high-heat corridors. The Office of Resilience will work closely with community partners to identify key corridors that could benefit from cooling interventions. Cool corridors will leverage great streets infrastructure elements, such as street trees and bicycle infrastructure, as well as the Strategic Mobility Plan to maximize the benefits of linking cooling strategies together. 
CHAMPIONS: AUSTIN TRANSIT PARTNERSHIP, CAPMETRO, OFFICE OF RESILIENCE, PLANNING, TRANSPORTATION & PUBLIC WORKS 
A concept developed by cities such as Phoenix, Arizona, cool corridors are segments of streets and sidewalks, longer than a quarter mile, that provide shading and cooling benefits to pedestrians and cyclists. When strategically implemented along pedestrian corridors in heat-vulnerable communities, cool corridors can minimize the impacts of extreme heat.", ,,

Ironically, social isolation also increases vulnerability to heat-related health impacts, particularly for older adults or people with disabilities who may be less able to obtain resources to prepare for extreme heat. Social isolation and extreme heat exposure can collectively worsen health risks such as depression, anxiety, and heart and respiratory dysfunction.

Connection and social cohesion are critical to developing heat resilient communities and positive public health outcomes. Community connections facilitate access to information, social and physical support, and facilitate group action to address collective problems. Extreme heat events can cause people to isolate themselves in their homes and limit interpersonal interactions. Ironically, social isolation also increases vulnerability to heat-related health impacts, particularly for older adults or people with disabilities who may be less able to obtain resources to prepare for extreme heat. Social isolation and extreme heat exposure can collectively worsen health risks such as depression, anxiety, and heart and respiratory dysfunction. People with pre-existing health issues, such as chronic and mental illness and substance use disorder are predisposed to experiencing social isolation.

Many municipalities open temporary cooling centers when a heat emergency is declared or designate a public building like the library or senior center as a cooling center. However, research shows that cooling centers are underutilized, to the point that some municipalities have stopped using this as a strategy. The following are some best practices and considerations to utilize when planning cooling center strategies and seeking to improve access and use of these spaces. See also Cool Communities Strategy 2 for Resilience Hubs. 
A.Identify sites that are already well utilized by the community, such as senior centers, libraries, schools, and recreational facilities, for use as cooling centers and advertise their status as cooling centers throughout the summer season, with strategic and inclusive branding. Consider extended center hours into the evening and make a plan for staffing if a heat emergency occurs at a time when these locations may be understaffed or typically closed. 
B. Ensure sites used as cooling centers are energy resilient by prioritizing these sites 
for microgrid development, renewable energy, and energy efficiency upgrades, and/or equipping sites with back-up energy storage or, if needed, generators. 
C. Provide programming at cooling centers, including arts and recreational activities, and provide amenities and services that help attract users and facilitate their access to resilience promoting resources (e.g., free WiFi, charging outlets, staffing service navigation help desks, and distribution of food, water, and cooling kits, etc.). 
D.Remove cooling center barriers by providing transportation to cooling centers, siting 
cooling centers along transit- and pedestrian-accessible locations and making pet accommodations. 
E. Collect data on cooling center usage and user experience to facilitate opportunities 
to make improvements to cooling center operations and communications over time.", ,,Search term > resilience (Weight: 0)

1) All Individuals 
• Keep Cool 
− Use air conditioning to cool down or go to an air-conditioned building such as a store, a library, or a cooling center. − If you don't have air conditioning in your home, open windows and shades on the shady side and close them on the sunny side to try to cool it down. − An electric fan can be beneficial but not reliable to cool off once the temperatures hit above the mid-90s (near or above body temperature of 98.6°F). NH DHHS, Emergency Services Function 8 26 
State of New Hampshire Excessive Heat Emergency Response Plan July 2014 
− Take a cool shower or bath. 
− Wear loose, lightweight, light-colored clothing to help keep cool. − Stay out of the sun as much as possible. 
− Never leave children, pets or those with special needs in a parked car, even briefly. 
Temperatures in the car can become dangerous within a few minutes. Even with the windows rolled down two inches, it only takes 10 minutes for the inside of a vehicle to reach deadly temperatures on a hot summer day. 
• Drink Fluids 
− Drink more fluids regardless of your activity level. 
− Avoid alcohol, caffeine and sugary drinks, since these actually cause you to lose more body fluid. − If you are on fluid restrictions or on diuretics, ask your doctor how much fluid you should drink. 
• Rest Frequently 
− Take regular breaks from physical activity, at least every hour. 
− Avoid strenuous activity during the hottest part of the day (between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.). 
• If you must be out in the heat 
− Try to limit your outdoor activity to morning and evening hours. − Cut down on exercise. If you must exercise, drink two to four glasses of cool, nonalcoholic fluids each hour. A sports beverage can replace the salt and minerals you lose in sweat. If you are on a low-salt diet, talk with your doctor before drinking a sports beverage. − Rest often in shady areas, at least every hour. 
− Protect yourself from the sun by wearing a ventilated wide-brimmed hat (e.g., straw 
or mesh) and sunglasses, and by putting on sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher (the most effective products say “broad spectrum” or “UVA/UVB protection” on their labels). ", ,,"Search term > mental (Weight: 0)

Factors contributing to increased risk for those with mental illness include: 
• Some medications used to treat mental illness, such as anti-psychotics, inhibit the body’s ability to regulate its temperature, leaving it more susceptible to heat stroke. 
• People with mental illnesses often live in impoverished conditions and without air conditioning, further increasing their risk. 
In addition to the tips for all individuals listed above, additional tips are listed below for caregivers, friends and neighbors of people with mental illness. 
Caregivers, friends and neighbors of those with mental illness should consider the following: 
− Visit or have daily contact with those people with mental illness, and especially those taking anti-psychotic medications. − Provide access to an air conditioner, or transport the person to an air-conditioned building or cooling center. − Make sure the person is drinking adequate fluids, and avoiding those that contain 
caffeine, alcohol, or large amounts of sugar, as these can cause more loss of body fluid. − Make sure the person is wearing lightweight and loose-fitting clothing. 
− A fan can be beneficial but not reliable to cool one off once the temperatures hit the high 90s. − Have the person take a cool shower or bath.", ,,"Search term > mental (Weight: 0)

AFRO,South Africa National Heat Health Action Guidelines 2020,Mental Health Outcomes  > DSM Classified Disorders > Depression,"Episodes of extreme heat have the potential to impact on the health system and infrastructure in general. Increased demand for services at primary health care clinics and casualty departments may mean additional personnel are needed and waiting times within these facilities are longer. The demand for emergency medical services also increases substantially during heat waves, with more people requiring emergency care and transport in the community, and more people needing transport from primary health clinics to hospitals. During periods of extreme heat, an increased number of patients will require admission to hospital, especially to general medical wards. These patients may have heat-related illnesses such as heat stroke, but also may require care for chronic diseases which have been aggravated by heat exposure, especially cardiac and respiratory conditions. Demand also rises for mental health services as heat exposure is linked with depression, stress, tiredness, substance use, aggression and suicide.", ,,"Search term > stress (Weight: 0)

Actions taken needs to reflect the different levels of heat–health warnings provided by SAWS. Care centres for elderly, those with severe mental or physical illnesses and other vulnerable groups need guidance on the steps to take during heat extremes, and a defined set of standards for addressing heat–health concerns, including the provision of a ‘cool space or room’. It is important to ensure that health workers know what to do to prevent the health impacts of heat on vulnerable population groups and individuals at particular risk.
